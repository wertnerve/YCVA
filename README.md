Youtube Channel Video Archiver is designed to streamlne the process of downloading all available videos from a Youtube Channel.

Whenlaunched, the app will prompt for the Channel URL, please enter in the below format

https://www.youtube.com/@channelName

Once entered, all available videos will be listed, and the user will be prompted for how many videos they wish to download from the list.

As an example, you can enter a channel with 100 current uploads, and enter 10 to set the program to only download the last 10 videos the creator uploaded.

At this time the program will onyl download in sequential order, starting from the most recent upload.

When the download completes, the program will close automatrically. The downloads are kept in a newly created folder titled after the channel, with each video in its own folder.

At this time the default download location is the user's Video Folder
